# Game Development in Python

This workshop goes through building a game in Python 3 using the PyGame Library

## How to Setup:

- Clone this repo to work locally
    - This workshop doesn't use Google Colab because Colab environments don't come with GPUs, so we can't run our games.
- Install a way to read Jupyter Notebooks
    - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is suggested for running the workshops locally. It includes a simple ipynb viewer.
    - You could [upload](https://jupyter.org/try) this entire repo to JupyterLab to work online, or [install](https://jupyter.org/install) JupyterLab locally.
- Install pygame and other libraries
    - `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

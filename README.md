# Game Development in Python

This workshop goes through building a game in Python 3 using the PyGame Library

## How to Setup:

- Clone this repo to work locally
    - This workshop doesn't use Google Colab because Colab environments don't come with GPUs, so we can't run our games.
- Install a way to read Jupyter Notebooks
    - The workshop is offered through a Notebook so that we can break down each part and provide a lot of detail
    - You could [upload](https://jupyter.org/try) this entire repo to JupyterLab to work online, or [install](https://jupyter.org/install) JupyterLab locally.
    - Or, you could open the repo in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and the Notebook can be viewed there
- Install the pygame library
    - `python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user`
